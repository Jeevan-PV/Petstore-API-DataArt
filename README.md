### üß™ Test Structure

The main test file is `UserCRUDTest.java`, which covers the full lifecycle of a user resource:

| **Test Method** | **Priority** | **Endpoint** | **Operation** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `testCreateUser_POST` | 1 | `/user` | `POST` | Creates a new user with a unique username. |
| `testReadUser_GET` | 2 | `/user/{username}` | `GET` | Verifies the newly created user exists. |
| `testUpdateUser_PUT` | 3 | `/user/{username}` | `PUT` | Updates the user's details (e.g., `firstName`). |
| `testReadUserAfterUpdate_GET` | 4 | `/user/{username}` | `GET` | **(Should be added)** Confirms the update was successful. |
| `testDeleteUser_DELETE` | 5 | `/user/{username}` | `DELETE` | Removes the user resource. |
